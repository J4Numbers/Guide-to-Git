# Guide to Git

Welcome to the interactive **Guide to Git**!

This repository will introduce you to what a Version Control System
(like Git!) can do for you as a developer and how to use it
effectively.

## What do I need to run these exercises?

All you need to run everything in this repository is [Git][1].

Optionally, you can also install the [GitHub client][2], but it _is not
required_.

## How is this repository split?

This repository is split into several exercises to be run through in
order.

1. What is a VCS and why should I care?
2. What is git? What about GitHub? (init, clone)
3. The simplest requirements (add, commit, push)
4. The git branching model (branch, checkout, merge)
5. How to fix what goes wrong (revert)
